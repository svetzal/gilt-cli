# Notes:
# - account_id values are the canonical keys used in processed outputs.
# - source_patterns help ingestion scripts route CSVs to the right account mapping.
# - possible_columns are suggestions for column mapping during normalization; exact mapping will be detected.
# - Do NOT place raw account numbers here. If needed, create a private mapping in data/private/ and git-ignore it.
